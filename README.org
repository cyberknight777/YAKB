* About

YAKB is a two-way modular android kernel build script written in bash which is extensive.

What it means to be two-way is that it is an argument-based script and a menu-based script.

* Usage

** CLI way

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  kver=<kernelbuildversion> zipn=<zipname> bash main.sh img mkzip
#+END_SRC

This builds the kernel and makes an anykernel3 zip.

** Menu way

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  bash main.sh
#+END_SRC

This executes the script and will show two prompts to enter value of kver and zipn. (This can be done for CLI way aswell.)
Next it will open a menu-based program which has 9 options for you to choose from.
